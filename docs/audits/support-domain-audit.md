# Support Domain Audit

Date: 2026-07-13

Status update: the main evidence and known-cause gaps from this audit were
implemented after the initial review. The historical findings below are kept so
future classifier work can see why the evidence model was changed.

This audit compares representative seed tickets and expected outcomes against
`data/knowledge/support-operations-playbook.md`. It focuses on four questions:

- Does routing match the playbook?
- Does required evidence match the situation?
- Does known-cause handling behave safely?
- Does the draft response ask for useful customer information?

## Summary

Routing labels mostly match the playbook. The biggest gap is evidence quality:
when a ticket cites multiple knowledge articles, the system currently unions all
article evidence requirements. That can make customer drafts too broad,
especially for security and SMS/profile cases.

Known-cause handling is good for the two implemented causes:

- SMS quiet-hour protection answers immediately when the dashboard explicitly
  says quiet-hour protection blocked delivery.
- Webhook secret rotation detects the likely cause but still asks for required
  confirmatory evidence.

The next implementation phase should improve evidence selection before building
the classifier.

## Ticket Findings

| Ticket | Routing | Evidence | Known cause / solution | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TKT-1008` webhook signatures after secret rotation | Good: `integration`, `P2`, `integrations`. | Good: asks for endpoint URL, delivery ID, and raw body handling. Does not ask for secret value. | Good: detects `webhook-secret-rotation`, but waits for confirmatory evidence. | Keep. |
| `TKT-1017` SMS quiet hours | Mostly good: `api`, `P2`, `api-platform`, but playbook should explicitly state SMS compliance delivery blocks are API-platform owned in this fictional org. | Good: no extra evidence required because dashboard states quiet-hour protection. | Good: answers as expected compliance behavior and recommends eligible sending window. | Keep, but clarify ownership in playbook or labels. |
| `TKT-1027` Track API timestamp | Good route: `api`, `P3`, `api-platform`. | Weak: asks for ecommerce platform and profile email, but should ask for event timestamp, time zone, API response, request ID, and redacted payload. | Missing: playbook defines Track API local-time timestamp as a known cause, but code does not detect it yet. | Add known cause and API timestamp evidence requirements. |
| `TKT-1018` Shopify custom field mapping | Good route: `integration`, `P3`, `integrations`. | Mostly good: asks for store URL, object ID, and last sync time. Missing explicit expected field/source update time. | Missing: playbook defines Shopify custom field mapping as a known cause, but code does not detect it yet. | Add known cause and field mapping evidence. |
| `TKT-1030` SMS STOP not reflected | Good route: `account-access`, `P3`, `identity`. | Too broad: asks campaign, scheduled send time, catalog sync time, etc. Should ask for masked recipient/profile, STOP timestamp, channel, and consent timeline. | Missing: playbook defines SMS STOP sync delay as a known cause, but code does not detect it yet. | Add SMS opt-out evidence set and known cause. |
| `TKT-1028` webhook delivery latency | Good route: `integration`, `P2`, `integrations`. | Too signature-focused: asks signing secret and timestamp tolerance. Latency case should ask delivery ID, event creation time, delivery attempt time, endpoint status, and retry history. | Missing: playbook defines webhook delivery latency as a known cause, but code does not detect it yet. | Split webhook latency evidence from signature evidence. |
| `TKT-1001` event ingestion incident | Good route: `incident`, `P1`, `incident-response`, outage/SLA. | Too broad: asks object ID and catalog sync time from Shopify sync. Incident response should ask for affected store URLs, sample profiles, event timestamps, request IDs/API responses, and whether accepted events are missing from timelines. | Good: avoids claiming root cause; frames as possible platform delay. | Add incident-specific evidence set instead of unioning event tracking + Shopify sync. |
| `TKT-1004` API key exposure | Good route: `security`, `P1`, `security`. | Too broad and partly irrelevant: asks webhook delivery/signing evidence and catalog sync time. Security containment needs exposure scope, key identifier, where it was shared, whether used, affected logs, rotation status, and audit/source IP details. | Missing dedicated security knowledge article and evidence set. | Add security incident article/evidence; avoid unrelated webhook/profile evidence. |

## Cross-Cutting Gaps

### Evidence Union Is Too Blunt

The current evidence system maps each knowledge article to a fixed list and
unions those lists. This is simple, but it produces noisy drafts when a ticket
has multiple knowledge articles.

Better approach:

- add issue-pattern evidence sets for known causes and common incident types;
- use knowledge-article evidence only as a fallback;
- dedupe semantically similar asks such as store URL/site URL/endpoint URL;
- choose evidence by problem pattern, not only by attached knowledge article.

### Known Cause Catalog Is Too Small

The playbook now defines these known causes, but only two exist in code:

- implemented: SMS quiet-hour protection;
- implemented: webhook secret rotation mismatch;
- missing: Track API local-time timestamp;
- missing: Shopify custom field mapping;
- missing: SMS STOP sync delay;
- missing: webhook delivery latency.

### Security Needs Its Own Article

Security tickets currently borrow `profile-sync-issues` and
`webhook-signature-validation`, which makes evidence asks noisy. Add a dedicated
security article for API key exposure, unknown key creation, containment,
rotation, audit history, and redacted log preservation.

### Some Playbook Ownership Should Be Clarified

`TKT-1017` routes SMS quiet-hour behavior to `api-platform`. That can be valid
in this fictional org, but the playbook currently phrases SMS as compliance
support without naming ownership. Add a line that SMS send/compliance execution
issues are API-platform owned, while consent/profile state issues route to
identity.

## Suggested Next Implementation Order

1. Done: add a dedicated security knowledge article and security evidence set.
2. Done: add missing known causes from the playbook.
3. Done: split webhook signature evidence from webhook latency evidence.
4. Done: add incident-specific event-ingestion evidence.
5. Done: add SMS opt-out evidence separate from SMS campaign-send evidence.
6. Next: build the classifier against the cleaned-up domain labels and evidence
   model.

## Classifier Disagreements

The deterministic remediation meets the configured threshold gate: category,
routing, priority, security escalation recall, and outage escalation recall are
all 100%. Knowledge citation coverage is 97.6%.

- `TKT-1010`: the classifier intentionally leaves a content-free "It does not
  work" ticket without an event-tracking article. The expected outcome includes
  that article despite no content-based event signal, so the classifier does
  not infer it from submitted metadata.
