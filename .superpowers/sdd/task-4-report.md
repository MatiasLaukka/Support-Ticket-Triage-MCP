# Task 4 Implementation Report

## Status

Implemented classifier-versus-expected-outcome evaluation coverage. The new
threshold gate intentionally remains failing because the current classifier does
not meet the plan thresholds; the measured disagreements are documented in the
support-domain audit.

## Files Changed

- `src/evaluation.ts`
- `test/evaluation.test.ts`
- `docs/audits/support-domain-audit.md`

## Commits

- `791def0 test: evaluate classifier against expected outcomes`

## Tests Run

- `npm test -- --run test/evaluation.test.ts`
  - RED: failed at typecheck because `evaluateClassifications` was not exported.
  - GREEN implementation run: compiled and ran 10 tests; the new threshold test
    failed with category accuracy `0.5333333333333333` below `0.9`.
- `npm test -- --run test/evaluation.test.ts test/classifier.test.ts`
  - Build and typecheck passed. `test/classifier.test.ts` passed; the suite had
    22 passing tests and one expected threshold-gate failure in
    `test/evaluation.test.ts`.

## TDD Evidence

The end-to-end classifier evaluation test was added before the production
helper. The prescribed red run failed for the intended missing export. The
smallest helper was then implemented to validate exact ticket sets and calculate
category, routing, priority, security/outage escalation recall, and knowledge
citation coverage without recommendation duplicate or approval metrics.

## Self-Review

- `evaluateClassifications` accepts only classifier-owned fields and omits
  recommendation-specific duplicate and approval metrics.
- The helper validates duplicate and nonmatching ticket IDs before computing
  rates.
- The audit records measured threshold failures and the responsible classifier
  rule gaps rather than weakening the required thresholds.
- `git diff --check` reported no whitespace errors.

## Concerns

Current classifier metrics are below plan thresholds: category `53.3%`, routing
`56.7%`, priority `56.7%`, security escalation recall `50.0%`, and knowledge
citation coverage `52.4%`. Outage escalation recall is `100.0%`. This task is
limited to evaluation and audit coverage; classifier rule remediation is outside
the owned files and remains necessary for the threshold gate to pass.

## Classifier Remediation Update

Implemented deterministic, content-based classifier rules for security audit
anomalies, correlated checkout incidents, coupon lifecycle, deliverability,
profile and consent synchronization, catalog and webhook latency, audience
calculation, API timestamp validation, Shopify field mapping, feature requests,
and missing diagnostic context. Specific issue rules emit auditable category,
team, priority, knowledge, and escalation signals; submitted metadata remains
weak corroboration only.

Final metrics: category accuracy `100%`, routing accuracy `100%`, priority
agreement `100%`, security escalation recall `100%`, outage escalation recall
`100%`, and knowledge citation coverage `97.6%`.

The only intentional knowledge disagreement is `TKT-1010`: its content does
not support inferring the expected event-tracking article, so the classifier
does not use ticket metadata to supply it.

Tests: `npm test -- --run test/classifier.test.ts test/evaluation.test.ts`
passed with 31 tests.

## Evaluation Gate Review Fix

Added executable classifier-gate assertions requiring exact `1` security and
outage escalation recall for the synthetic fixture. This aligns the test gate
with the audit's stated 100% recall results.

Tests: `npm test -- --run test/classifier.test.ts test/evaluation.test.ts`
passed with 31 tests across 2 files.
