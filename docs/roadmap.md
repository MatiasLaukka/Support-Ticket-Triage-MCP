# Project Roadmap

This roadmap keeps the project focused on credible automation evidence rather
than feature sprawl.

## Near-Term Polish

1. Keep screenshots current when the Approval Desk UI changes.
2. Add a short GIF using `docs/capture-guide.md`.
3. Keep `npm run demo:showcase` as the main public entry point.
4. Add a short architecture video or walkthrough script only if it stays
   synthetic and repeatable.

## More Realistic Support Scenarios

Add 5-8 messy synthetic merchant tickets that stress the workflow:

| Scenario | What it should test |
| --- | --- |
| Vague angry merchant report | Empathetic draft tone and focused evidence requests. |
| Wrong merchant assumption | GPT should avoid blaming the customer and ask for proof. |
| Partial outage report | Incident wording without overclaiming confirmed impact. |
| Duplicate event names | Technical draft mode and event disambiguation. |
| Conflicting ticket metadata | Deterministic policy should override stale labels. |
| Prompt-injection plus real issue | Safety handling without losing the valid support problem. |

Each new ticket should have:

- a seed ticket;
- an expected outcome;
- relevant local knowledge coverage;
- at least one test or evaluator assertion;
- a customer response expectation that is understandable to non-technical
  users.

Next backend slice:

- expand known-cause coverage for repeated merchant issues that are not yet
  modeled, keeping each cause backed by synthetic documentation and tests;
- improve evidence extraction for explicit negative evidence such as "not
  changed", timestamps and time zones, platform/store/account facts from ticket
  text plus replies, and duplicate evidence asks across overlapping knowledge
  articles;
- add local conversation fixtures keyed by ticket ID, covering first contact,
  partial information, complete information, platform-fix context, and resolved
  confirmation.

## Response Quality Improvements

The current GPT drafting path is intentionally bounded. Next improvements
should target quality without weakening governance:

- add style-specific acceptance tests for `concise`, `empathetic`,
  `technical`, and `executive-update`;
- add a max-length validator for customer responses;
- add a validator warning when the draft asks for irrelevant information;
- add a "known cause vs needs diagnosis" label to the safety panel;
- add examples of good and bad customer replies in `docs/demo-results.md`.
- improve `search_knowledge` recall so operator lookups surface the same
  knowledge articles that classifier rule mappings cite;
- normalize customer-facing evidence labels so list items read naturally, for
  example `Event ID or event time` instead of lowercase sentence fragments;
- keep GPT assist bounded: deterministic lifecycle and evidence state decide
  what the response must accomplish, while GPT can polish customer-facing
  wording and provide auditable advisory classification signals for ambiguous
  conversation context.

## Production-Like Extensions

These are useful later, but should stay behind the same approval boundary:

- **SQLite learning ledger (implemented):** durable, queryable learning events,
  candidate/version/audit transaction boundaries, verified outcome capture,
  maturity/health projections, stale and contradiction signals, and a
  deterministic future-ticket reuse showcase. The operational plane remains
  authoritative and the JSON/in-memory adapters remain available for tests and
  replay.
- **Full operational SQLite migration (implemented):** tickets, conversations,
  recommendation/diagnosis revisions, causal events, safe decision traces,
  persistent command replay, explicit import states, and the learning outbox
  now share one transactional operational boundary. HTTP, MCP, and the browser
  carry stable command IDs, and the Decision Timeline survives restart.
- Zendesk or Jira read adapter for imported tickets;
- provider-specific field mapping and revision checks;
- durable recommendation store outside local JSON files;
- real identity and reviewer attribution;
- webhook verification and idempotency for external updates;
- separate evaluation set for customer-response quality.

The next persistence work is operational hardening rather than another state
store: backup/restore drills, deployment packaging, readiness reporting, and
external-provider reconciliation should consume the existing operational and
learning interfaces without bypassing domain authority.

## Keep Out Of Scope For The Demo

- automatic outbound customer messaging;
- autonomous ticket closure;
- real customer data;
- hidden approval shortcuts;
- vendor documentation copied from third-party platforms.
